In this thesis, a file backed shared memory system was implemented, which can be used to share \emph{sys-sage} topologies between processes and nodes in HPC systems.
The shared memory regions used to transfer the topologies between the processes are implemented with memory mapped files created using the \lstinline|mmap()| syscall.

To share a \emph{sys-sage} topology, the exporting process recursively copies all components, including attribs and DataPaths, of the chosen topology into the created shared memory region.
Since the virtual memory addresses inside the shared region, all pointers within the topology must be translated to offset based pointers.

All importing processes can then recreate the topology in their local memory, translating the offset based pointers back into regular pointers and recreating the component tree structure.

The performance of the implemented shared memory system is tested using multiple example topologies with different amounts of components, attribs and DataPaths.

Additionally, some limitations of the presented implementation are discussed and suggestions for future improvements are made.
